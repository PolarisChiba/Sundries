At first, there is nothing in a three-dimension space $S$.

There will be $Q$ operations of the following two kinds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $1$ $x$ $y$ $z$: Add a point $(x, y, z)$ into $S$
    \item $2$ $x$ $y$ $z$: Find the Manhattan distance of $(x, y, z)$ and the farthest point in $S$
\end{itemize}

Please note that the point in the second kind of the operation won't be added into $S$.

---

% Input format

The first line of the input contains an integer $T$($1\leq T\leq 5\times 10^5$) --- the number of testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains an integer $Q$($1\leq Q\leq 10^6$) --- the number of operations.

Each of the next $Q$ lines contains four integers $a_i$、$x_i$、$y_i$、$z_i$ --- the $i$-th operation.

$a_i\in \{1, 2\}$、$|x_i| \leq Q$、$|y_i|\leq Q$、$|z_i|\leq Q$

It is guaranteed that the total sum of $Q$ doesn't exceed $10^6$.

It is guaranteed that the first operation in each testcase is adding a point into $S$.

% Output format

For each second kind of operation, print an integer --- the maximum Manhattan distance of the given point and the points in $S$.

---

% Notes

The manhattan distance of $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is $|x_1 - x_2|+|y_1 - y_2|+|z_1 - z_2|$.
