A period of a string is a prefix that can be used to generate the whole string by repeating the prefix. The last repetition may be partial. For example, the periods of $abcabca$ are $abc$, $abcabc$ and $abcabca$.

Given a weighted string $S$ with size $n$, the weight of the $i$-th character of which is $w_i$.

The weight of substring $S[L\cdots R]$ is $\sum_{i=L}^{R} w_i$.

Among all period of $S$, we call the one with the maximum weight "maximum period".

Your task is to find the weight of the maximum period of $S$.

\InputFile
The first line of the input contains an integers $n$ --- the size of $S$.

The second line of the input contains a string $S$ with size $n$.

The third line of the input contains $n$ integers $w_1, w_2,\cdots, w_n$ --- the weight of each character of $S$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item $1 \leq n \leq 10^6$
  \item $|w_i| \leq 1000$
\end{itemize}

\OutputFile

You should print an integer which represents the weight of the maximum period of $S$.
