## About

ICPC WF 2002 - TBD

My understanding of each problems.

## Format

In general, each problem should contain
* Title
* Link to the problem
* Description
* Remark
* Input Format
* Output Format
* Example
* Solution
* Proof
* Time complexity
* AC code

Though some sections may not be included in some cases.

For example, proof may not be included if the solution is straightforward enough.

**Each section should be concise and has no nonsence.**
